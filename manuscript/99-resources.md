{#ref-bass-2012}
##### Bass+2012

Bass, L/Clements, P/Kazman, R.: _Software Architecture in Practice_

3rd edition, Addison-Wesley, 2012. Although the title suggests otherwise, a quite
fundamental (and sometimes abstract) book.
The authors have a strong background in ultra-large scale (often military)
systems - so their advice might sometimes conflicts with small or lean kinds of projects.
