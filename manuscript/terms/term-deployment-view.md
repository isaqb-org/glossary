### Deployment View

Architectural view showing the technical infrastructure where a system or artifacts will be
deployed and executed.

  "This view defines the physical environment in which the system is intended to run, including the hardware environment your system needs (e.g., processing nodes, network interconnections, and disk storage facilities), the technical environment requirements for each node (or node type) in the system, and the mapping of your software elements to the runtime environment that will execute them."
