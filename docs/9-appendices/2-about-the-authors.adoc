==== Matthias Bohlen

Matthias Bohlen, http://mbohlen.de[independent expert] for effective product development, started his career as a software developer in 1980. He wrote compilers for the MC68020 processor by Motorola which was quite a revolutionary device in those days where there was no IBM PC, yet. And the compilers really sold well.

Since then, Matthias has worked with countless software teams, helping them to get working software out the door without losing their mind. This is what he still does today.

Matthias is an active member of the http://www.isaqb.org[International Software Architecture Qualification Board], writes http://mbohlen.de[a blog], is being known in the Lean/Agile field, and speaks at conferences for software development.

==== Simon Kölsch

Simon Kölsch works as a senior consultant at INNOQ with a focus on web architecture and security.

Simon is enthusiastic about solutions beyond the classical monolithic enterprise application, covering the architecture of distributed systems and their infrastructure, logging and monitoring.

He is not committed to one specific technology or programming language, but has a strong JVM background.

==== Alexander Lorz

Dr.-Ing. Alexander Lorz is a freelance software architecture trainer, IT consultant and developer. His first contact with IT systems dates back to the mid-1980s, and since then he has refused to give up his fascination for the science and craftsmanship of developing complex systems.

As an active member of the International Software Architecture Qualification Board (http://isaqb.org[iSAQB® e.{nbsp}V.]) and the Foundation Level Working Group he contributes to the evolution of the foundation curriculum.

==== Michael Mahlberg

Michael Mahlberg runs his own https://consulting-guild.de[method consultancy] in Germany and spends most of his time supporting clients in their quest for more effective ways to work. Mostly by applying lean and agile concepts.

Running his own computer and software related companies since he was 18, he quickly came to realize that software architecture and (development) processes are in a way timeless aspects of the craft.

Nowadays a lot of his work focuses on processes and human interactions – a field in which he engages both professionally as well as pro bono (for example he is one of the people who started and run the http://lwscologne.de[Limited WIP Society Cologne]).

Michael's architectural work therefore tends to be dealing with the impact(s) and implications of architectural and process decisions _on each other_ and the relative optimization strategies.

==== Andreas Rausch

Prof. Dr. Andreas Rausch is head of the chair for Software Systems Engineering at Clausthal University of Technology.

He received his doctorate in 2001 at the Technical University of Munich, at the chair of Prof. Dr. Manfred Broy.
His main research interests in the field of software systems engineering are software architectures, model-based software development and process models.
He has published more than 70 international papers in these areas.

==== Roger Rhoades
