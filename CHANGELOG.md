# What's new?
## 2025.1
We added a lot of new terms and fixed some explanations with this release. We decided to use a new major version since two years passed since the last release. 

## 2023.1
This is the very first GitHub release of the iSAQBÂ® Glossary for Software Architecture Terminology. 

More info will be added with future revisions of this release.
